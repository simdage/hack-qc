## CMP notes

Files:
- data_analysis.ipynb : Draft notebook to analyse signal, explore patterns and what size signal we can use. I think 1 day analysis could be enough for most errors. More investigation needed, year visualization done with this notebook.
- data_preprocessing.ipynb : transforming the csv file to a data ready format + saving json file with all info contained in headers of excel files. These processed files has been saved into our gdrived under processed_csv.
- build_dataset.ipynb : building a dataset to get daily signal. Analysizing that option has an input to model.
